Part 1: Examine QSTK_Tutorial_1. You can use that code as a template for this assignment.


Part 2: Write a Python function that can simulate and assess the performance of a 4 stock portfolio.
Inputs to the function include:
Start date
End date
Symbols for for equities (e.g., GOOG, AAPL, GLD, XOM)
Allocations to the equities at the beginning of the simulation (e.g., 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.1)
The function should return:
Standard deviation of daily returns of the total portfolio
Average daily return of the total portfolio
Sharpe ratio (Always assume you have 252 trading days in an year. And risk free rate = 0) of the total portfolio
Cumulative return of the total portfolio

An example of how you might call the function in your program:
vol, daily_ret, sharpe, cum_ret = simulate(startdate, enddate, ['GOOG','AAPL','GLD','XOM'], [0.2,0.3,0.4,0.1])
Some assumptions:
Allocate some amount of value to each equity on the first day. You then "hold" those investments for the entire year.
Use adjusted close data. In QSTK, this is 'close'
Report statistics for the entire portfolio


Part 2.5: Make sure your simulate() function gives correct output. Check it against the examples below.


Part 3: Use your function to create a portfolio optimizer!
Create a for loop (or nested for loop) that enables you to test every "legal" set of allocations to the 4 stocks. Keep track of the "best" portfolio, and print it out at the end.
"Legal" set of allocations means: The allocations sum to 1.0. The allocations are in 10% increments.
Example legal allocations: [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.7]
"Best" portfolio means: Highest Sharpe Ratio.


Part 4:
Create a chart that illustrates the value of your portfolio over the year and compares it to SPY.
